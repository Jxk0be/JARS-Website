                    Officially we are the Japanese Animanga Research Society, which is a 
                    rather fancy title for what essentially amounts to an anime-manga club 
                    at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville. 
                    <br> <br>
                    Our primary interest is anime and manga, but many of our members dabble 
                    in many different form of Japanese media such as light novels, visual 
                    novels, vtubers, doujins, games, etc and we seek to actively discuss, 
                    debate, learn more about these various forms of entertainment.

                    JARS due to a variety of factors including the pandemic and perhaps 
                    slight mismanagement hasn’t really existed for several years. It existed 
                    to some extent on discord with occasional online meetings, but this was 
                    merely a former shadow of itself.
                    <br> <br>
                    JARS, and its IRL meetings were revived in 2022 and we’re glad to be back in business.

                    Typically, we play a quick game of animanga related kahoot. After which 
                    we may watch 1-2 anime episodes (this season it seems we are watching 
                    Chainsaw Man together). And then we have a “special activity” 
                    which changes every week. 
                    <br> <br>
                    You’re free and encouraged to chitchat, 
                    vibe, play video games, etc during meetings if you want. Having a good 
                    time and rolling on the floor laughing is our ultimate goal.

                    However, this is subject to change.

                    Officially it goes from 7:30PM – 8:30PM. However, we encourage people 
                    to stay as long as they feel like to talk to the other members and 
                    vibe. We have frequently found ourselves still chitchatting well past 
                    midnight.
